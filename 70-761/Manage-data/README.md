### Create Transact-SQL SELECT queries

* Identify proper SELECT query structure
* Write specific queries to satisfy business requirements
* Construct results from multiple queries using set operators
* Distinguish between UNION and UNION ALL behavior
* Identify the query that would return expected results based on provided table structure and/or data

### Query multiple tables by using joins

* Write queries with join statements based on provided tables, data, and requirements
* Determine proper usage of INNER JOIN, LEFT/RIGHT/FULL OUTER JOIN, and CROSS JOIN
* Construct multiple JOIN operators using AND and OR
* Determine the correct results when presented with multi-table SELECT statements and source data
* Write queries with NULLs on joins

### Implement functions and aggregate data

* Construct queries using scalar-valued and table-valued functions
* Identify the impact of function usage to query performance and WHERE clauses argability
* Identify the differences between deterministic and non-deterministic functions; 
* Use built-in aggregate functions
* Use arithmetic functions, date-related functions, and system functions

### Modify data

* Write INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements
* Determine which statements can be used to load data to a table based on its structure and constraints
* Construct Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements using the OUTPUT statement
* Determine the results of Data Definition Language (DDL) statements on supplied tables and data
